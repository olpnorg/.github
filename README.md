# Open Legal Publishing Network (OLPN)

The **Open Legal Publishing Network (OLPN)** is building tools for **decentralized identity and legal publishing**.  
Our mission is to connect **verified lawyers, firms, and organizations** to the content they create, forming a **legal graph** that is portable, trustworthy, and machine-readable.

> **Note:** OLPN is currently in early development. The codebase will be **open-sourced soon** once it reaches stability.

## Core Projects

| Project | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [OLPN ID](https://github.com/olpn/olpn-id) | WordPress plugin to turn any site into an **identity hub** or **credentialing organization**. Best for law firms, bar associations, and legal networks. |
| [OLPN Clusters](https://github.com/olpn/olpn-clusters) | WordPress plugin for **structured content**, internal linking, and optimized URL design for SEO and **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**. |
| [OLPN Resolver](https://github.com/olpn/olpn-resolver) | **Go-based verification service** hosted at [olpn.org](https://olpn.org). It validates identities, credentials, and content relationships, returning trusted JSON-LD data. |

## Why OLPN

- **Ownership** – Identities and content stay with the people and organizations who create them.
- **Portability** – Move between platforms without losing trust or relationships.
- **Discovery** – Power legal search and AI with verifiable, machine-readable context.
- **Transparency** – Open standards and a roadmap to full open-source development.
